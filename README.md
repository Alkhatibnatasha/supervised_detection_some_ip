# Supervised Intrusion Detection for SOME/IP protocol
SOME/IP is an automotive/embedded communication protocol which supports remote procedure calls, event notifications and the underlying serialization/wire format. In this project, we use deep learning algorithms to detect cyberattacks on SOME/IP. This repository contains the source code and data for our research paper: "Deep learning-based intrusion detection for SOME/IP protocol" by Natasha Alkhatib, Maria Mushtaq, Hadi Ghauch, Jean-Luc Danger.
