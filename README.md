# Supervised Intrusion Detection for SOME/IP protocol
SOME/IP is an automotive/embedded communication protocol which supports remote procedure calls, event notifications and the underlying serialization/wire format. In this project, we use deep learning algorithms to detect cyberattacks on SOME/IP.
